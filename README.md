# Codec2 runs at ESP32 to connect M17 reflectors

This is an implementation of Codec2 for the ESP32 (Arduino). 
This version is just weekend project, you can make a wifi walkie talkie just by using esp32 dev-board, microphone amplifier and speaker amplifier modules.

At the moment, it is just a lots of spaghetty code. It works and no one knows why and how. I may update, clean, apply style etc, in the future.

You <u>need to have an AMATEUR RADIO LICENCE</u> in order to use.

# Install
This library do not have an installer, just copy the codec2 folder to your Arduino library folder.

Codec2 is a low-bitrate speech audio codec (speech coding) that is patent free and open source develop by David Grant Rowe.
